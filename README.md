# Machine Learning: Supervised Learning

Concept: Algorithm learns from comes with the correct answers. The model is created to predict the answer for new unknown values.

## Classification
Prediction problem that predicts the categorical class labels which are discrete and unordered. 
It is a two-step process, consisting of a learning step and a classification step.



## Regression
Regression outputs are continuous numbers, they are ordered.


## Algorithms for classification
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Linear Regression
